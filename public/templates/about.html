<h1>About this application</h1>
<p> In my Poll application, I decided to use the MEAN stack(fully javascript framework): MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js. NodeJS is anopen source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux with no changes. MongoDB is a NoSQL and document-oriented database. To make the model mapping with the database, I use Mongoose, that is a Node.js library that provides MongoDB object mapping similar to ORM with a familiar interface within Node.js.  ExpressJS is  is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Angularjs I think I don't need to explain :). 
I thought that it was a good oportunity to learn a new way of doing web applications. Because I am new to this
technology, I faced some problems, I could not make the PUT for polls. However, I made all
the others RESTful web services, including POST and DELETE for Poll model. </p>

<p>
In this project, in the root directory, there are the server.js file that is responsible for provide the RESTful services, package.json that contains the dependencies of the project. I put my the models in a directory 'models'. In the directory public, I put the index.html file as well as the css directory, that has the styles for this app, the directory js, that contains the controllers and resourses directories. In the directory vendor, I put the external javascript necessary for the angujarjs. In the directory templates, there are the html files. In the about.html, there is the description of the system. In the create.html, we have the page that receive the informations to create a poll and save it. In the poll.html file, a single poll with its option is shown. Also, in this file, we get informations to save a vote. In polls.html, we have all the polls with a link to each one, as well as a link to the current results for each one.
